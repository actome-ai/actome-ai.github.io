# ActomeAI Portal Website (Source Code)

This repository hosts the **source code** of the ActomeAI portal website, built with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and the [NexT theme](https://theme-next.js.org/).

👉 The live website is available at: **https://actome-ai.github.io**

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **main branch**  
  Contains the Hexo project files (source, themes, configuration, assets).  
  This branch is for writing posts, editing pages, and updating site configuration.  

- **gh-pages branch**  
  Contains the static site files automatically generated by Hexo (`public/`).  
  GitHub Pages reads this branch to serve the live website.  
  You should **not edit this branch directly**.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Write or update content in the `main` branch.
2. Generate the static site:  
   ```bash
   hexo clean && hexo generate
   ```
3. Deploy to gh-pages:
  ```bash
   hexo deploy
  ```
4. GitHub Pages will update the website automatically.

## 📖 About ActomeAI

ActomeAI is an initiative to build an open platform for multimodal animal behavior analysis, combining neuroscience, AI, and reproducible research.    
The website serves as the portal for our vision, projects, documentation, and community updates.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Do not push the public/ folder or node_modules/ into the main branch.
- All website updates should go through main → build → deploy → gh-pages.
- If gh-pages is accidentally overwritten, simply regenerate and redeploy.
